            <h4>Reinstaller is a plugin for Mod Organiser 2 that allows you to backup and reinstall downloaded files without cluttering the downloads panel.</h4>

            <p>When working with large modlists, it's quite common to need to reinstall a mod to pick different compatibility options. 
                Finding the mod in a relatively cluttered downloads folder, assuming it wasn't deleted accidentally, can be a challenge.</p>
            <p>There are also large multi-patch installers that are designed to be run every time you change your mod list, which also have no place to be stored except left in the downloads folder.</p>
            <p>Reinstaller helps with this by allowing you to save mods from the downloads folder and re-run the installation for them from the Tools menu.</p>
