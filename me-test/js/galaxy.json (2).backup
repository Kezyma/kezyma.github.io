Volus culture lacks the romantic view of war found in the galaxy's more aggressive species. Physical skirmishes between groups rarely last long, and are almost always ended by social castigation, bargaining agreements, or harsh economic sanctions. <br/><br/>Irune's cities tend to be built on fast trade routes rather than militarily defensible positions. This has left them vulnerable to husk attack now that the Reapers have overwhelmed the turian fleets and begun a ground war on the planet.<br/><br/>CITADEL TRAVEL ADVISORY: Irune's ammonia-based atmosphere is toxic to non-volus life-forms.

Eldfell-Ashland Energy's mining operations made it the largest source of starship drive core material in the Attican Traverse, which threatened Caleston's native biodiversity with industrial waste.<br/><br/>Caleston is wracked with volcanism due to tidal stresses from Cernunnos. Because of weak solar output, plant-like life on Caleston is not carbon-based and photosynthetic, but silicon-based and thermosynthetic, requiring heat rather than sunlight to power chemical reactions. These organisms flourish in volcanic vents and during solar flares, when Balor, Caleson's sun, can double or triple in luminosity. Oxygen-breathing habitation is not possible outside its many domed cities. Those cities are now feasts for the Reapers, who drove off Caleston's protective fleet and now threaten to puncture domes to force the population into submission.<br/><br/>Colony Founded: 1975 CE<br/>Population: 1.8 billion<br/>(All pop. estimates are pre-invasion.)<br/>Capital: Syneu<br/><br/>Orbital Distance: 0.07 AU (orbits Cernunnos)<br/>Orbital Period: 21.5 Earth Hours (around Cernunnos)<br/>Radius: 6,600 km<br/>Day Length: 21.5 Earth Hours<br/>Atmospheric Pressure: 0.9 Earth Atmospheres<br/>Surface Temperature: 30 Celsius<br/>Surface Gravity: 1.2 G",

The camp was immediately closed, and the remains sent back to their worlds of origin. An inquest by the Blue Suns found the batarians had used harsh training methods, but these were consistent with their own training to join the SIU. The batarians were exonerated, though Kal'thor was shut down, and they were reassigned to other units. No criminal charges were filed against the Blue Suns: Council law did not extend to the Crescent Nebula, and the asari on Illium found the Blue Suns' self-policing to have met their due diligence requirement for corporate justice.<br/> <br/>Orbital Distance: 15.6 AU<br/>Orbital Period: 47.4 Earth Years<br/>Radius: 30,054 km<br/>Day Length: 13.7 Earth Hours",

The asteroid was decelerated from Borr's orbit using fusion torches, allowing it to fall into the orbit of Terra Nova.<br/><br/>Recently, communications with the engineering team on X57 have been lost. The fusion torches have reignited, and the asteroid is accelerating towards Terra Nova.<br/><br/>Asteroid X57 has been brought under control. Once repairs are complete, the asteroid will be carefully maneuvered into geosynchronous orbit around Terra Nova.

A salarian mining expedition initially discovered the planet, which was promptly strong-armed away from them by organized crime figures. Hagalaz's exploration rights were then sold to the highest bidder, which led to a brief burst of mining colonies in the 2000s, but most of those were abandoned when other planets were found with more accessible resources.<br/><br/>Though Hagalaz has a nitrogen-oxygen atmosphere capable of supporting life, its rotational period is slower than Earth's, making its day and night 98 Earth days long. The intense heat on one side of the planet and the extreme cold on the other make for violent storm cells wherever the sun is rising or setting. As a result, the flora and fauna of Hagalaz have developed the capability to live in cycles of ice, flooding, baking heat, and dramatic air pressure changes. The biota of the planet has been largely unexploited by the exotic pet and gardening trades, since simulating their natural conditions is problematic for the average consumer.<br/><br/>Orbital Distance: 0.95 AU<br/>Orbital Period: 1.0 Earth Years<br/>Radius: 6,309 km<br/>Day Length: 98.3 Earth Days<br/>Atmospheric Pressure: 0.83 Earth Atmospheres<br/>Surface Temperature: 72 Celsius (day) -64 Celsius (night)<br/>Surface Gravity: 0.69 G",

All five clan warlords agreed to a Crush (a meeting at a neutral location) to negotiate a truce. Unfortunately, all five arrived planning to betray their fellows. While the leaders and their seconds met, all their bases were destroyed by simultaneous hypervelocity cannon strikes.<br/><br/>Left with only the food, water, and air in their hardsuits, and with no way to call for rescue, the warlords apparently fought each other to the death. The survivors of the five Durak Clans on Tuchanka still argue about which clan's warlord was the last one standing.<br/> <br/>Orbital Distance: 0.83 AU<br/>Orbital Period: 0.6 Earth Years<br/>Radius: 1,972 km<br/>Atmospheric Pressure: Trace<br/>Surface Temperature: 348 Celsius<br/>Surface Gravity: 0.22 G",

In fact, krogan astronomers had correctly deduced the nature of Kruban in the years before the global holocaust. In the two millennia since, Kruban had come to be thought of as an ideal test of one's toughness.<br/><br/>Every year, a few krogan attempt to land on Kruban and exit their ships naked in an attempt to prove their kroganhood.

Though far too hot for habitable planets, Nith emits thousands of times the energy of a main sequence star like Earth's Sol.<br/><br/>With help from salarian uplift teams, the krogan constructed a chain of solar power collector stations in orbit around Nith. These vast arrays beamed power to particle accelerators on the surface of Mantun, which manufactured antiproton fuel for warship thrusters. In the Krogan Rebellions, the Spectre agents managed to get a virus into the computers of the solar power arrays; every fifth array suddenly applied braking thrusters. The arrays behind them piled up, and all were reduced to wreckage. This has since dispersed into a relatively stable ring system.<br/><br/>The krogan never had the resources to rebuild the solar arrays, depriving them of their fleet's main fuel supply for the remainder of the war. The particle accelerators still exist on Mantun, but have not been used in thousands of years.<br/><br/>Orbital Distance: 57.2 AU<br/>Orbital Period: 112.1 Earth Years<br/>Radius: 2,150 km<br/>Atmospheric Pressure: Trace<br/>Surface Temperature: 641 Celsius<br/>Surface Gravity: 0.28 G",

Two decades after its first colony was founded, its population had reduced by half due to fatalities and a large colonist exodus. But when the primarchs considered ceding the planet to robo-mining interests, the turian statesman Shastina Emperus ambitiously declared that she would start her own colony and double its population within five years.<br/><br/>This effort succeeded, largely due to the colonies' location in deserts with a minimal number of pest species. The image of Shastina's triumph in the frontier made for good political theater, and the turian population poured in. The planet's tropical belt still remains largely unexplored, as its aggressive organic life still wreaks havoc on turian biology. A house in an Invictus jungle is a modern turian phrase for an idea that seems like a good idea, but only to the one who came up with it.<br/><br/>Invictus's atmosphere is primarily nitrogen and oxygen, and its surface crust varies but has high concentrations of alumina and silver. Because it can support life easily, criminals from throughout the Terminus Systems hide out on Invictus. Its official population is estimated to be half the number of sapients that are actually on the planet.<br/><br/>Colony Founded: 1939 CE<br/>Population: 320 million (est. 640 million with illegals)<br/>Capital: Shastinasio<br/><br/>Orbital Distance: 1.3 AU<br/>Orbital Period: 1.5 Earth Years<br/>Radius: 7,260 km<br/>Day Length: 31.6 Earth Hours<br/>Atmospheric Pressure: 1.15 Earth Atmospheres<br/>Surface Temperature: 30 Celsius<br/>Surface Gravity: 1.5 G<br/><br/><br/>",

Between the high price and a surface littered with unexploded ordnance, however, Gellix found few reputable tenants. Its most notable inhabitants were penal colonies.

Among members of the Council militaries, being assigned to the station is seen as a form of punishment or exile, considering that there have been no signs of sapient life on Suen for over a thousand years.<br/><br/>Station Length: 332 m<br/>Mass: 106,000 metric tons<br/>Population: 340",

The most famous is that of the slaver Silparon, who worked to death 420 slaves over the course of a galactic standard year, and ground up their bodies for compost in his greenhouses.

The outermost of Dirada's two asteroid belts is thought to have been a small planetoid that was broken up by Siano's passage into the system.<br/><br/>Siano is formed of low-density rock and is tidally locked to Dirada; the same hemisphere always faces the star. There is evidence that a complex of artificial structures once existed in the north of the sunward-facing hemisphere, but they have been badly degraded by millennia of heat and radiation. Several bunkers of radioactive waste, apparently byproducts of primitive fission plants, have been discovered on the far side.

It was far from an idyllic settlement--like many Terminus worlds, it was rife with farmers growing psychoactive substances, armed gangs, and with genetic engineering that would be illegal in Council space--but aside from the maddening heat and photoperiod, it was quite inhabitable.<br/><br/>The Reapers turned Chalkhos to rubble. Emergency broadcasts caught in the light-cone coming from the planet indicate that the Reapers used ground forces to invade and spent little time harvesting.

This led development firms to colonize at the planet's equator, where the climate is tolerable for agriculture. <br/><br/>The quarians, seeking a homeworld of their own, petitioned the Citadel Council for the right to take over Ekuna, but they had already settled a few hundred thousand quarians on the planet before approaching the Council. Seeing this occupation as an illegal act, the Council turned a deaf ear to quarian pleas and gave the world to the elcor, who could withstand the high gravity of the world far better. The quarians squatting on the planet were given one galactic standard month to leave, at which point their colonies would be bombarded. The junk left behind by the fleeing quarians clogs up portions of the landscape to this day.<br/><br/>Non-elcor visitors to Ekuna are advised to use personal or vehicular mass effect fields to lighten the pressure, as the surface gravity will otherwise cause health and mechanical problems.<br/><br/>Colony Founded: 2103 CE<br/>Population: 221 million<br/>Capital: Bel Shadii (elcor: Durawunafon)<br/><br/>Orbital Distance: 1.6 AU<br/>Orbital Period: 2.3 Earth Years<br/>Radius: 10,206 km<br/>Day Length: 36.4 Earth Hours<br/>Atmospheric Pressure: 1.4 Earth Atmospheres<br/>Surface Temperature: -37 Celsius (equator mean temperature 15 Celsius)<br/>Surface Gravity: 4.1 G<br/>",

The planet is highly volcanically active, leading to periodic releases of toxic gases into the air and water supplies, as well as other extreme situations that gave rise to the vorcha's legendary adaptability. Overcrowding and the extermination of most of their ecology led to a planet covered in weeds and hardy vermin. <br/><br/>The vorcha do not have a recognized single government that would allow them membership in any galactic league. Alliances between bloodlines are tenuous at best, and the vorcha's short, violent lives ensure there are few lasting institutions.<br/><br/>The Reaper invasion of Heshtok encountered little formal military resistance, but the harvesting process is slow. Destroying neighboring cities fails to intimidate vorcha, who become submissive only if physically dominated in person. Cutting off their water supply simply makes them adapt their bodies to get moisture from food. Allied intelligence hypothesizes that Reaper forces are not harvesting yet, instead seeking to immobilize Heshtok's population and prevent them from joining the fight for the galaxy at large.<br/><br/>Population: Lack of census data spreads estimates from 6.0-9.3 billion (pre-invasion)<br/>Capital: Hatash (disputed)<br/><br/>Orbital Distance: 0.75 AU<br/>Orbital Period: 0.72 Earth Years<br/>Radius: 3,902 km<br/>Day Length: 44.9 Earth Hours<br/>Atmospheric Pressure: 0.27 Earth Atmospheres<br/>Surface Temperature: 32 Celsius<br/>Surface Gravity: 0.695 G",

Several asari mining corporations, working with a siari-based charity called Mind and Hand, built settlements on the planet's surface and orbital stations. Adopting vorcha orphans from Heshtok, they raised them to live nonviolent lives and employed them in the mining industry. <br/><br/>While Mind and Hand's efforts were at first labeled colonialist, the orphans became minor celebrities when it was discovered that the vorcha habit of using violence to communicate was not completely innate. Several spoke throughout Citadel space on behalf of their species, but their short life spans kept their careers very brief. Even today, companies that want vorcha labor have the poor choice between adopting and educating them as youngsters just to watch them age and die or dealing with autonomous but violent adults.<br/><br/>The Reaper invasion devastated Parasc. Its industrial capacity was ruthlessly targeted, and the vorcha mining communities were exterminated. The only silver lining is that the deaths here have created martyrs, inspiring other alien-raised vorcha to fight for their galaxy.<br/><br/>Orbital Distance: 1.7 AU<br/>Orbital Period: 2.5 Earth Years<br/>Radius: 2,283 km<br/>Day Length: 49.1 Earth Hours<br/>Atmospheric Pressure: Trace<br/>Surface Temperature: -85 Celsius<br/>Surface Gravity: 0.32 G",

The vorcha's own culture disenfranchised them in Naskral's case, as their legal claims to the planet were inevitably backed up by violence as a show of dominance. This nuance was lost on the mining corporations, who hired mercenaries to guard their operations with lethal force and never surrendered it to vorcha claimants.<br/><br/>The Reapers sent a small force to destroy Naskral's orbital stations and surface facilities.

The planet is largely frozen, yet it features native dextro-amino-acid-based life in its lower latitudes. These species evolved to withstand periodic freezing and compensate for the cold with spectacular population explosions during the long, mild summers. <br/><br/>Hardy, independent-minded turians colonized the planet. The quarians briefly considered contesting them but were daunted by the virulence of the planet's infectious life during the growing season, not to mention the colonists who had ties to warlords elsewhere in the Shrike Abyssal.<br/><br/>Altakiril's citizens were wiped out by Reapers bombardment despite the planet having a reasonably high population, which would usually make it a candidate for harvesting. Allied intelligence suggests that the colonists kept anti-space defense weaponry in population centers, so the Reapers limited their risk by destroying the threat and moving on.<br/><br/>Colony Founded: 2021 CE<br/>Population: 13.5 million<br/>(all pop. estimates are pre-invasion)<br/>Capital: Estivus Erax<br/><br/>Orbital Distance: 1.6 AU<br/>Orbital Period: 2.3 Earth Years<br/>Radius: 4,145 km<br/>Day Length: 19.2 Earth Hours<br/>Atmospheric Pressure: 1.19 Earth Atmospheres<br/>Surface Temperature: -24 Celsius",

By the turn of the next century, Garvug's narrow strips of coral reef had been destroyed by overfishing and pollutants, and excess krogan took to the stars to find another planet to consume. Garvug was treated as an object lesson by the Citadel Council--the krogan could not be trusted to check their own numbers.<br/><br/>Today, Garvug is a frozen wasteland, home to corporate eco-engineering efforts trying to implement sustainable agri- and aqua-culture practices.
